# Patatap-Clone

## Based off of Patatap: https://patatap.com/
* This is a mini-version of the idea

* It uses the Paper.js framework. 
* Paper.js is an open source vector graphics scripting framework that runs on top of the HTML5 Canvas. It offers a clean Scene Graph / Document Object Model and a lot of powerful functionality to create and work with vector graphics and bezier curves, all neatly wrapped up in a well designed, consistent and clean programming interface.

* **How to Play; Press any key A-Z and make sure your speakers are turned on and volume up.**
